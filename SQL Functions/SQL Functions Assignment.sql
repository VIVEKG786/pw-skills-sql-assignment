rank() over(order by score desc) as Rank_ 
from Student_Performance;



-- Question 2 : Show each student's score and the previous student’s score (based on score order).
-- Ans:

select name, score,
lag(score, 1) over(order by score desc) as Previous_Student_Score
from Student_Performance;

-- Question 3 : Convert all student names to uppercase and extract the month name from join_date.
-- Ans:
